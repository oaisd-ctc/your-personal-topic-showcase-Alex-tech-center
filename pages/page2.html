<h1>Devolopment</h1>

<p>Half-life's devolopment had several issues along the road, such as trying to get the game working with limited time because their publisher then wanted a strict deadline.</p>

<p>Most of the devolopers used to work a microsoft. After microsft grew larger they didn't want to wokr in such a big company so two people split off and wanted to start their own game company</p>

<p>The first two were Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell</p>

<p>"On the surface, we should have failed. And realistically, both I and Mike thought we'd get about a year into it and realize we made terrible mistakes and go back to our friends at microsoft and ask for our jobs back."</p>
<p>Said Gabe in the 25th anniversary documentary for Half-Life.</p>
<p>"We did think we knew a fair bit about software devolopment, that there were expertese that goes into it. I think we also had some pretty clear ideas of how to design a company."</p>
<p>"So when were were building Half-Life, we were designing Valve at the same time."</p>
